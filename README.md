# Advanced AutoReset Mod

## About The Project

This mods allows resetting Random and Set Seeds. 

Currently it is allowed for the PogLoot leaderboards but not for the java edition boards. 
Every button can be moved by shift + right-clicking on it.
Every text can be changed by a resource pack

## Resetting with the mod

From your pause menu go to -> options -> AutoRset Options to open the AutoTeset settings. 

There you can find a list of the seeds often used for set seed speedruns and an entry called "Random Seed". Either double click on an entry or click "Use seed"  with the entry selected to reset with that entry.

When you have the seed you want to reset with selected, click on the diamond boots button on the title screen. The mod will automatically create worlds with the seed you selected.
If you have the random seed entry selected the mod will create worlds with a random seed, just like the original autoresetter.
With the autoresetter being active, the mod will create a new world with the selected seed upon exiting one.

Click on the "Stop resetting and quit" button in your options menu to stop the autoreset mod and return to the title screen.

Shift + right-click on the title screen button to cycle through the difficulties. The mod will then use the selected difficulty when creating a world.

## Navigating through the settings

1. Editing attempts: The mod will automatically increment the number of attempts when creating a world. To edit these attempts simply enter the desired number of attempts into the field in the bottom left.
2. Adding a Seed Entry: Click on the "Add Seed" button to create a new entry. You can enter a seed, a name, a description, a version. All of these are completely optional. To set a custom icon click the "Set Icon" button. Your file explorer will open where you can put your 64x64 icon file into. This icon will be saved in your minecraft/advanced-auto-reset folder. If you don't add a custom icon the mod will choose one of 18 minecraft textures as an icon.
3. Moving the button in the title screen: To move the diamond boots button in the title screen click on the button in the bottom right with the default name "Top Left"
